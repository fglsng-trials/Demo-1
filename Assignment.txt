Assignment:

Make 2 applications (.NET) . They need to use a message broker (Azure eventhub , Rabbitmq, Kafka or other).

 

1.       Producer app. Produces a message with a timestamp and a counter (int) in a loop with a delay.

2.       Consumer app 

1.       Take message from queue. If the message timestamp is over 1 minute old - then discard it

2.       If the message is under 1 minute old and the second on the timestamp is an even number, then put the message in a database (azure db, postgres, mongo, other)

3.       If the message is under 1 minute old and the second on the timestamp is an odd number, then put the message back in the queue with a counter increment of +1

4.     Ensure the business logic is covered by unit tests.
